# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks by using the TensorFlow platform in Python to analyze and classify charitable donations from the data provided by Alphabet Soup. The data consists of 34,000 organizations that have received funding. 

* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
* Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
* Deliverable 3: Optimize the Model
* Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Neural Network Model


## Results

### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model

1. What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  
  *
  *
  *

2. What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

  *
  *
  *

3. What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

  *
  *
  *

### Deliverable 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

1. How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

  *
  *
  *

2. Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

  *
  *
  *

3. What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
